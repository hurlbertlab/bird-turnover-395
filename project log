Completed: transfer project w BBS files onto lap computer
Goals: elevation calculation and filter in data subset script: extract function
- spTransform 
converting coordinate systems 
need to determine whether BBC coord system was correctly identified, transformation may be incorrect bc not proper starting system

reorganize subset script/add step clarification

3/3
fixed elev mostly
cali coming up NA, site 3 and 18 repeats with different name

run BBS to save weather csv

3/5

filtering bbs by elev now working

need to fix NA's 
how to write/save final counts list 
* convert to data frame, save as csv
*data.frame, site var connecting 
change final count list loop to use dist_list_elev 

3/6
change cali bbc coords in data * document clearly *
(dist_list_elev reading 0 results bc of NA in elev right now)

** transient check throwing errors, unknown origin

California Palomarin station/Bolinas quadrangle latitude/longitude column values do not match coordinates in description. 

Inferred Actual Site Coordinates: 37.929934, -122.735254
Cannot distinguish between three sites with given coordinates, attempt to triangulate with location details in American Birds journal

3/19
coords issue unresolved

transience issue due to 0 inputs for points without elevation

3/24
issue resolved where dropbox caused process error

coords issue unresolved

added nlcd land class csv into analysis script

need to count individuals seen at each bbc and bbs and put into graphic

3/27
determined rough est of 2 out of 3 palo locations, need to document reasoning and change data

isolated list of bbs routes sampled for each bbc site and saved into csv to transfer to analysis script

attempted construction of landcover code but no data to run as of yet
