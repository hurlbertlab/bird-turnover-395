2/25
Completed: transfer project w BBS files onto lap computer
Goals: elevation calculation and filter in data subset script: extract function
- spTransform 
converting coordinate systems 
need to determine whether BBC coord system was correctly identified, transformation may be incorrect bc not proper starting system

reorganize subset script/add step clarification

3/3
fixed elev mostly
cali coming up NA, site 3 and 18 repeats with different name

run BBS to save weather csv

3/5

filtering bbs by elev now working

need to fix NA's 
how to write/save final counts list 
* convert to data frame, save as csv
*data.frame, site var connecting 
change final count list loop to use dist_list_elev 

3/6
change cali bbc coords in data * document clearly *
(dist_list_elev reading 0 results bc of NA in elev right now)

** transient check throwing errors, unknown origin

California Palomarin station/Bolinas quadrangle latitude/longitude column values do not match coordinates in description. Coordinates in column data plot as offshore locations whereas coordinates in description plot to palomarin station in google earth. Column data altered to match description coordinates for all sites. Original values saved in storage column. Coastal scrub and Grazed coastal scrub site renamed to coastal scrub A as coordinates match in both column data and description coordinates.

Inferred Actual Site Coordinates: 37.929934, -122.735254
Cannot distinguish between three sites with given coordinates, attempt to triangulate with location details in American Birds journal
